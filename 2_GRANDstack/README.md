# GRANDstack

In this module we'll use the `create-grandstack-app` CLI to create a fullstack skeleton application using GraphQL, React, Apollo, and Neo4j Database. We'll then make some updates to the application to convert it to a movies search application using the Recommendations Neo4j Sandbox. Finally, we'll see how to deploy the application to Netlify.
